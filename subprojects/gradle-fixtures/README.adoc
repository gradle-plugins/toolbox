= Gradle Testing Fixtures

The Gradle testing fixtures are a set of classes accelerating Gradle plugin development by providing assertion for common scenarios.
We extracted the fixtures from the link:https://github.com/gradle/gradle[Gradle codebase] for every plugin developer to benefit.
Head over to link:https://nokee.dev/docs/nightly/samples/gradle-plugin-development-with-testing-strategies/[the testing strategy sample] to see them in action.

== Usage

Apply the following plugin in your `settings.gradle[.kts]`:

.settings.gradle
[source,groovy]
----
pluginManagement {
    repositories {
        gradlePluginPortal()
        maven { url = 'https://repo.nokee.dev/release' }
    }
}
----

.build.gradle
[source,groovy,subs=attributes+]
----
plugins {
    id("dev.gradleplugins.gradle-plugin-development") version("{jbake-version}")
}
----

NOTE: Head over to link:https://nokee.dev/docs/nightly/manual/gradle-plugin-development-plugin.html[the reference chapter] to learn more about the `dev.gradleplugins.gradle-plugin-development` plugin.

Then add the project repository in your build script, e.g. `build.gradle[.kts]`:

[source,groovy]
----
repositories {
    gradlePluginDevelopment()
}
----

Finally, add a dependency on the Gradle testing fixtures:

[source,groovy]
----
dependencies {
    testImplementation(gradleFixtures())
}
----
